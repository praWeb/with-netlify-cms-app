Was recently looking at my credit score and was shocked to see I have some negative points(as per my bank/credit insurer) as I haven't ever taken any debt or actually missed any payments. It turned out me never taking anything on a credit card is a bad thing. As a common man, who generally be cautious at my finances this is a real shock to me. This made me to think deep about our whole life style.

During this conversation, I have realised that we live in a world of consumerism and corporates wants us to stuck with life full of debts and posses things which really doesn't matter to us.
