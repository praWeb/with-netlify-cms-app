Mental clutter impacts our performance and concentration. Constant worry about future, never ending to-do list, ruminating about the past, un-realistic goals/dreams etc., contribute a lot to mental clutter. The way removing clutter in the house ends up having more space, getting rid of mental clutter gives more joy and happiness to life. It will give you a clarity of thought and purpose of life.

Again, saying this is lot easy, than implementing in our real life. It took me almost a year to get it done in my life. Few instant results of this process given me the constant motiviation to keep trying it. Here are the steps I have followed.

## 1. Identify what excites you

Getting out of bed is really a big thing, and stepping out of the house in UK cold weather is another major obstacle to start my day. So I always look for something that excites in the day. If I dont find any, I will try to add something. It could be as simple as learning about a new feature of my phone. And the same with my life. I kept trying the things that excites me as a part of my routines.

## 2. Be clear on your priorities

When you see from far, everything on your to-do list does sound like a high priority one. But when you pause for a minute, and give a thought about them, you would easily find things which are not that important. I started writing down the all the tasks I need to perform, and then prioritise them. In this way, I can always finish things which are more important. And the same way with my life activities.

## 3. Record your learnings and obstacles you are facing

This whole declutter process is an experiment of my life. I kept recording all the things I was learning through out this process. Writing this down, at times helped me in seeing things bit more clearly.

## 4. Declutter your physical environment

You might be cool with messy things being around. But trust me once you clear that mess, you will never want to go back. I have cleared every corner of my house, literally every inch of my house over couple of months doing things bit by bit. During this process I have removed all unwanted stuff in my house. Now it is so easy for me, to clean my house everyday. And I know whatever is left in this house, is something I use. I am still trying to get rid of more stuff, as I am loving to have only minimal things. This practise also helped me tuning my brain and to keep my thoughts in control.

## 5. Declutter your thoughts. Stop worrying and start living

We constantly think about something or other. Most of the times, those are the things which actually doesn't matter or make any difference to our life or surrounding. We need to be smart while feeding our brain. The way we don't feed unhealthy stuff to our belly, we need to be careful regarding what information we are feeding to our brain. After stopping unhealthy info flows to my brain, I ended up more freedom in my life. Now I have less things to worry and also don't have to worry about things, which I have absolutely no control over.

## 6. Let go of the past

I have discovered this while decluttering my thoughts. I was bullied during my school and college life. And this has deep rooted in my brain where sub-consciously it created many fears of my life. I was also in depression at many stages of my life. It was actually a constant battle of my life for many years. I lost hope on my future as I was constantly thinking of my past and living in present with past memories. Only after realizing that there is nothing much I can do about my past and its all over now, I started seeing how beautiful my present is. I always wish I had done it sooner.

## 7. Declutter your relations

I had people in my life who always brings negative energy and it is so exhausting to keep up the relation with them. You know what being nice to those people is not that necessary. Feel free to get rid of those relations. So that now you have time for those remaining positive people. End of the day all we need is positivity.

## 8. Improve focus, avoid multi tasking

I always try to multi task. Even when writing this article, I was watching TV which actually impacted my writing. And it goes the same with anything. The more we try to multi-task the more we fail and the more stress we develop. At times, I multi-task because I cannot say no to the people who asked me for a help. But then I realize it is actually not helping any one (sometimes it may, but not in general). When I started doing one thing at a time, I can see a clear improve in my focus and also in the quality of work.

## 9. Add physical exercise to your daily routine

Here by physical exercise I doesn't mean going to a Gym. It could be as simple as a 30 min walk in your garden. For many it is usually a walk to their work place or to a grocery store. So ditch that vehicle and go for a walk. I generally practise yoga in the morning and it helps me a lot in maintaining my calmness and positivity through out the day. If I feel stressed at work, I just extend my walk back home and roam in the city and watch people in the streets. It helps me in getting distracted from my stress moments and come back to normal.

## 10. Ensure you have enough rest

Typically my day starts around 6AM and ends around 10PM. I get tired by end of day pretty badly. The minute my body touches the bed it feels like a heaven. I am one of those persons who calculate the time left for my sleep and will be relaxed only if I know that I am going to get 8 hours of sleep(It may sound crazy, but yeah I do it almost everyday). Rest is must.

## 11. Ensure you have Me time

We should never forget after all this is just one life to live and enjoy. So I always ensure I have some Me time during the day, where I just unwind and start enjoying the little moments of my life. This is the time where I just sit and relax and reflect on my life

After a year of practising this decluttering process, now I have time for things I love to do. Now I always have time for the people who wants to have me in their life. So why dont you give it a try and see how it changes your life. Would love to hear your thoughts about this. Feel free to contact me on my [email](mailto:prasanna.virigineni@gmail.com)
